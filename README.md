## Authors notes:

DISCLAIMER
This script isn’t really meant to be helpful its just supposed to be a script for more looks and roleplay purposes.

Walk up to the vehicle and the message tells you what to do when you are close to the door. (THE DOOR MESSAGE CAN BE TOUCHY TO FIND SO MOVE AROUND THE DOOR AND SEE IF THE MESSAGE POPS UP.

WHAT DOES THIS DO?
All this does is when you have the saw equipped you can walk up to a vehicles door and press E and it will start to cut off the vehicles door.

Controls / Commands
/saw – Toggles saw on / off

… That’s it …

NOTICE
I understand that there was an unreleased OLD script going around that looks just like this one that had some different credits on it. That script was NEVER to be released to the public and was distributed without my permission and I am sorry if any of you were fooled by that individual. Just want everyone to know that script was wrote by me a long time ago and had my name replaced with his.

Sorry for the inconvenience. Enjoy this new saw script though!
